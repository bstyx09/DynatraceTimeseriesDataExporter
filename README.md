This is a tool for pulling timeseries data from the Dynatrace API

It uses a simple GUI for users to build and execute their api calls and report on the results of those calls.
The data is output to a table and in a json format to make the data more easily accessible. Each call is also logged in the tool as well.

Data from the table can easily copied and pasted into Excel for further manipulation. This solves a pretty significant hurdle a lot of users may have with using data returned from the API.

Currently has been tested with Dynatrace version 1.186 but should still work with most other versions that allow for USQL api calls
